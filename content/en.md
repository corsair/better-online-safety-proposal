## Preface

**The internet needs to be made safer for children.** However, laws such as the [Online Safety Act](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer) in the United Kingdom, the [Digital Services Act](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en) ("DSA") for the European Union, and [Kids Online Safety Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1748/text) in the United States risk causing long-standing harm to adults and online platforms alike.

Presently, the process of identity verification is broken. This proposal presents a new, globally adoptable implementation of identity verification that accomplishes the primary goals of these laws, while substantially eliminating risks of identity theft and privacy violations.

## Core Principles

### Choice
**It is imperative that individuals have complete control over what personally identifiable information an online platform can access or request.**

Before an identity is verified, personal information that will be shared with the online platform *must be clearly communicated to the individual*, and they should have the option to reject before proceeding with identity verification.

##### **Concern:** Identity verification services that collect identification documents or passports allow for access to all personal information. Individuals cannot consent nor are clearly communicated as to what specific information is shared with the services.

### Limits
**Quality over quantity. It is paramount that online platforms that require identity verification limit information requests to what is absolutely necessary.**

In most instances of identity verification, it is only necessary to determine if the individual is an adult. Online platforms should only request personally identifiable information (i.e., full name, address) if applicable or required for usage.

##### **Concern:** The collection and storing of personally identifiable information is commonly abused, and a major safety concern of many individuals. This has contributed to an overall distrust and rejection of identity verification on existing online platforms. Reducing stored information is paramount to reducing harm from unauthorized access and compromised databases.

### Ethics
**The ability to verify identities must be fair and non-discriminatory if considered mandatory by law.**

The process of verifying an identity must be logistically and financially reasonable for both the online platform and individuals. Governments with laws requiring identity verification must either provide their own verification services, or sponsor services that comply with their requirements to eliminate or otherwise reduce costs for all parties.

##### **Concern:** The current state of identity verification poses many challenges. Smaller online platforms may be unable to justify the cost of verifying all individuals at the risk of bankruptcy, whereas larger online platforms may need to reduce workforces.

## Proposal

### 1. Open Identity Verification Standard

Governments must work together to create a universally accepted framework for identity verification that mimics "OAuth".

Online platforms register with an identity verification service and are provided with a Client ID and can provide acceptable Redirect URIs.

When initiating an identity verification process, the online platform will define what information they require as scopes (i.e., "Age", "Full Name"), or can elect to simply determine if the individual is an adult.

### 2. Consent-Based Verification Process

When the individual is redirected to the verification service, personal information disclosed to the online platform **must be clearly communicated and disclosed** prior to any identifiable documents, biometrics, or AI process begins.

The individual must manually accept this information disclosure. If accepted, the service can begin their verification process utilizing any appropriate methods.

If the individual refuses, return them to the online platform which will then handle the "failure to verify" accordingly.

### 3. Encourage Credential-Based Verification

Governmental bodies that require verification are encouraged to provide an optional means of creating and registering an online account that is solely owned and associated with the individual (citizen).

Once an account is created, individuals can verify their identity via a government-sponsored identity service (either managed by the government or in partnership with) either permanently or temporarily.

This account can then be utilized by the individual as account owner on registered online platforms to quickly and effortlessly gain access.

### 4. Keep In Communication

As content policies change, governments must strive for easily accessible and open communication with online platforms to encourage compliance.

## The Path Forward

This proposal represents a starting point for meaningful dialogue between governments, technology companies, and civil society. Implementation will require:

- International cooperation to establish common standards
- Public engagement and feedback
- Phased rollouts with pilot programs
- Regular review and adaptation based on real-world outcomes
- Transparent reporting on effectiveness and privacy protection

## Glossary
